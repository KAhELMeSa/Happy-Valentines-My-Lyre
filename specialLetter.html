            <p>From the very first moment we met, I knew that something special was beginning. These months together have been filled with so much love, laughter, and unforgettable memories. I can’t imagine my life without you by my side.</p>
            <p>You’ve supported me through thick and thin, always encouraging me to be the best version of myself. I am so grateful for your patience, understanding, and all the little things you do that make my world brighter every day. Your love is a constant source of strength for me.</p>
            <p>As we celebrate another year of valentines together, I want you to know just how much you mean to me. You are my heart, my joy, and my home. I love you more than words can ever express, and I feel so lucky to call you mine. Mahal na mahal kita my sweet Lyre.
